# SARMR

# Overview
Implement for Self-supervised Adversarial Regularization model for Medication Recommendation (SARMR)

This is the implement for our model in the paper Self-supervised Adversarial Regularization model for Medication Recommendation, which aims at recommending medications effectively. 

SARMR obtains informative patterns from raw EHRs for adversarial regularization to shape distributions of patient representations for Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) reduction, and such a self-supervised adversarial regulrization requires no extra external knowledge about DDI. SARMR firstly obtains temporal information from historical admissions, and builds a key-value memory network with patient representations and corresponding medications. Then SARMR carries out multi-hop reading on the memory network to model interactions between patients and physicians while a graph neural network is used to embed the results into meaningful embeddings. Meanwhile, SARMR regulate the distribution of patient representations with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to match it to a desired Gaussian distribution for DDI reduction.

# Data

Experiments are carried out based on [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org)ï¼Œ which is a real-world Electoric Healthcare Records (EHRs) dataset, and it collects clinical information related to over 45,000 patients. The diagnoses and procedures are used as inputs of SARMR, and the medications prescribed in the first 24 hours of each admission are selected out as ground truths.

Patient records are firstly selected out from the raw data into a file, and each line contains the information for a single admission in the form of \[subject_id, hadm_id, admittime, medications, diagnoses, procedures\].You could find an example below.

\[17, 194023, 2134-12-27 07:15:00, A12A; C01C; B05C; N07A; A12C; A07A; N01A; C02D; M01A; A10A, 2724; 45829; 7455; V1259, 3571; 3961; 8872\]

After constructing the vocabulary for medical concepts, i.e., assigning a identical integer to each medical concepts, medications, diagnoses, and procedures are represented by corresponding integers, and patient records are transformed into a np.array, while each element in the array represents information for a single patient in the form \[adm_1, adm_2, ..., adm_n\]. For each adm_i, the form is \[\[med_1, med_2, ..., med_m\],\[diag_1, diag_2, ..., dig_d\],\[pro_1, pro_2, ..., pro_p\],\[ddi rate\]]. For instance, we could find an example below, and there are two admissions in the example. For the first admission, the medications are 3, 4, and 5, the diagnoses are 6 and 7, the procedures are 8 and 9, and the ddi rate is 0.3.

\[\[\[3, 4, 5\], \[6, 7\], \[8, 9\], \[0.3\]\], \[\[10 ,11\], \[12, 13, 14\], \[15, 16\], \[0.2\]\]\]

# Hyper-parameters
We use bayesian optimization to tune hyper-parameters, and conduct the optimization using [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize) speficially. Lists of all final parameters as well as range of values tried per parameter during development could be found in dictionary Hyper-parameters.
